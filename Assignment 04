Q1. What exactly is []?

Ans. [] :it's is a emplty list, like a =[]

Q2. In a list of values stored in a variable called spam, how would you assign the value 'hello' as the third value? (Assume [2, 4, 6, 8, 10]     are in spam.)
Ans. 
            spam= [2, 4, 6, 8, 10]
            spam.insert(2,'hello')


 Note : Let's pretend the spam includes the list ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd'] for the next three queries.

Q3.  What is the value of spam[int(int('3' * 2) / 11)]?

Ans. ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd']

Q4. What is the value of spam[-1]?

Ans. d

Q.5 What is the value of spam[:2]?

Ans. ['a', 'b']

Note : Let's pretend bacon has the list [3.14, 'cat', 11, 'cat', True] for the next three questions.

Q6. What is the value of bacon.index('cat')?

Ans. 1

Q7. How does bacon.append(99) change the look of the list value in bacon?

Ans. [3.14, 'cat', 11, 'cat', True, 99]

Q8.  How does bacon.remove('cat') change the look of the list in bacon?

Ans. [3.14, 11, 'cat', True]

Q9. What are the list concatenation and list replication operators?

Ans. The List concatination operator ( : ) concatinates value into a list, the value all be the same type. 
     The List replication operator creates multiple concatinated copies. 

Q10. What is difference between the list methods append() and insert()?

Ans. The append () menthod is used to insert the data/value in last, But in method we insert the value/data by location. 

Q11. What are the two methods for removing items from a list?

Ans. pop() & remove ()

Q12. Describe how list values and string values are identical.

Ans. List and string both are used to store value /data and both are sequence. string are used to store character in single or double            quotes. list are mutable and string are immutable.

Q13. What's the difference between tuples and lists?

Ans. The two major diffence between tuples and list 
        Touple is immutable but the list is mulatble
        Touple consume less memory as compare to the list 
        
Q14. How do you type a tuple value that only contains the integer 42?

Ans. A=tuple([45])

Q15.  How do you get a list value's tuple form? How do you get a tuple value's list form?

Ans. li=[1,2,3,4,5,6]
     tu=(1,2,3,4,5)
     t=tuple(li)      #using this method we can get the list value into tuple form
     c=list(tu)       #using this method we can get the tuple value into list form
     
Q16. Variables that "contain" list values are not necessarily lists themselves. Instead, what do they contain?

Ans. They contain references to list values

Q17.  How do you distinguish between copy.copy() and copy.deepcopy()?

Ans. The copy.copy() function will do a shallow copy of a list, 


        import copy
        a=[1,2,[3,4],5,6]
        b=copy.copy(a)
        print(id(a)==id(b))
        print(id(a[2])==id(b[2]))
        
        o/p : False
              True
        
But the copy.deepcopy() function will do a deep copy of a list. only copy.deepcopy() will duplicate any lists inside the 
list
        import copy
        a=[1,2,[3,4],5,6]
        b=copy.deepcopy(a)
        print(id(a)==id(b))
        print(id(a[2])==id(b[2]))

        0/p : False
              False
