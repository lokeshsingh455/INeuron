Q1. What are the two values of the Boolean data type? How do you write them?

Ans: The two values of the Boolean data type is '0' & '1'.
            True : 0
            False: 1

Q2.  What are the three different types of Boolean operators?

Ans: There are three type of Boolean operator
            1.AND
            2.OR
            3.NOT

Q3. Make a list of each Boolean operator's truth tables (i.e. every possible combination of Boolean values for the operator and what it evaluate ).

Ans :   AND operator   0 0 0
                       0 1 0
                       1 0 0
                       1 1 1
        
        OR operator    0 0 0
                       0 1 1
                       1 0 1
                       1 1 1
                       
       NOt operator    0   1
                       1   0
                       
Q4.  What are the values of the following expressions?
        (5 > 4) and (3 == 5)                  : False / '0'
        not (5 > 4)                           : False / '0'
        (5 > 4) or (3 == 5)                   : True  /  '1'
        not ((5 > 4) or (3 == 5))             : False / '0'
        (True and True) and (True == False)   : False / '0'
        (not False) or (not True)             : True  /  '1'

Q5.  What are the six comparison operators?

Ans : The Six comparison operator is :
                    1. a>b
                    2. a<b
                    3. a<=b
                    4. a>=b
                    5. a=b
                    6. a!=b

Q6. How do you tell the difference between the equal to and assignment operators?Describe a condition and when you would use one.

Ans. When we assisgn any value to the variable we use " = " but when we compare the data we use " == " or " ====" 

                        Example: for assignment 
                                        a=24
                                 for comparison 
                                        if a==24:
                                            print("xyx")

Q7.Identify the three blocks in this code:
spam = 0
if spam == 10:
print('eggs')
if spam > 5:
print('bacon')
else:
print('ham')
print('spam')
print('spam')

 Ans :   if spam ==10:
         if spam >5:
         else:

Q8. Write code that prints Hello if 1 is stored in spam, prints Howdy if 2 is stored in spam, and prints Greetings! if anything else is     stored in spam.

Ans.

spam=int(input ("Enter the number"))
if spam==1:
    print("Hello")
elif spam==2:
    print("Howdy")
else:
    print("Greetings !")
 
Q9.If your programme is stuck in an endless loop, what keys youâ€™ll press?

Ans.  ( ctrl -c ) is used to stop the infinite loop

Q10. How can you tell the difference between break and continue?

Ans. Break statement is used to come out from the loop after condition True / False
     But in the case of continue statement we keep continue the condition untill the loop auto finish.

Q11. In a for loop, what is the difference between range(10), range(0, 10), and range(0, 10, 1)?

Ans. 
        range(10) : This condition interpriter taking by default start value '0'
       range(0,10): In this condition we just proving the start value ( from where the value will start )
     range(0,10,1): In this condition we are providing three values ( start: range : difference)

Q12.  Write a short program that prints the numbers 1 to 10 using a for loop. Then write an equivalent program that prints the numbers 1 to       10 using a while loop.
Ans.
        for loop:  for i in range(1,11):
                       print(i)


      While loop:   i=1
                    while i<=10:
                        print(i)
                        i+=1    

Q13.  If you had a function named bacon() inside a module named spam, how would you call it after importing spam?

Ans.   spam.bacon()
